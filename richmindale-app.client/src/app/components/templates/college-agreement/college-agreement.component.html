                            Richmond applied for admission and transfer of credits to a degree program at Richmindale
                            College, and paid
                            $100 for the admission/registration fee and another $75 for the transfer of credit

                        <p class="indented mt-2">
                            On July 1, Richmond and Richmindale College signed an enrollment agreement. On the same day,
                            Richmond
                            enrolled in five 3-credit classes, a total of 15 credits, for a semester with classes that
                            start on September 1. The
                            semester tuition is $1500, calculated as $100 multiplied by 15 credits. The semester
                            miscellaneous fee is $150,
                            calculated as $10 multiplied by 15 credits. The total cost for the semester is $1650,
                            excluding the
                            admission/registration fee and the transfer of credit evaluation fee. Based on the terms of
                            payment, the total cost
                            for the semester is divided into 3 payments. Each monthly payment is equal to $550,
                            calculated as $1650 divided
                            by 3. Richmond paid the first monthly installment (payment 1 of 3) of $550. One of the
                            courses requires a software
                            license. Richmond purchased the software license worth $100[1] from a third-party vendor.
                            Richmond paid a total
                            of $725 as initial payment to Richmindale College for his admission application ($100),
                            transfer of credit evaluation
                            ($75), and first installment of his enrolled courses ($550). Richmond also spent $100,
                            separately, on the required
                            software license subscription for one year from a third-party vendor.

                            Richmond decided to cancel/withdraw and wrote a cancellation notification letter with
                            effective withdrawal date
                            of July 5, signed and dated the letter, and mailed it to a Richmindale College office on
                            July 5. The mail took 7
                            calendar days to reach Richmindale’s office. Richmindale College received the mail on July
                            12. Since Richmond’s
                            withdrawal date is July 5, which is within five calendar days after signing the enrollment
                            agreement, and he sent
                            the mail on or before the withdrawal date, Richmindale College must refund Richmond all

                            amounting to $725[1] within 30 calendar days (by August 4). The refund amount includes the
                            admission/registration fee, transfer of credit evaluation fee, and first monthly
                            installment; but does not include

                            If Richmond mailed the notification letter after the effective withdrawal date of July 5,
                            let’s say July 7, Richmindale
                            College would have used the mailing date of July 7 as the effective withdrawal date, which
                            does not fall under the

                        <p class="indented mt-2">(c) I have received a copy of the school catalog.</p>
                        <p class="indented mt-2">(d) The school may terminate my enrollment if I fail to comply with
                            attendance, academic and financial requirements,
                            or if I disrupt the normal activities of the school. While enrolled in the school, I
                            understand that I must maintain
                            Satisfactory Academic Progress as described in the attached school catalog and that my
                            financial obligation to the
                            school must be paid in full before a certificate may be awarded.</p>
                        <p class="indented mt-2">(e) The information concerning other institutions that may accept the
                            school’s credits toward their programs can be
                            obtained from such institutions. It should not be assumed that any programs described in the
                            school catalog could
                            be transferred to another institution. The school does not guarantee the transferability of
                            credits to a college,
                            university, or institution. Any decision on the comparability, appropriateness, and
                            applicability of credits, and
                            whether they should be accepted is the decision of the receiving institution.</p>
                        <p class="indented mt-2">(f) The school reserves the right to reschedule the program start date
                            when the number of students enrolled is less
                            than five.</p>

                            achievements, including images or
